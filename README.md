# Final-Project-APCS1.

<h1><b> DAY IN THE LIFE OF A STUY STUDENT!!!</b> </h1><br><br>

This project is a Choose Your Own Adventure game where the user plays as an ordinary Stuy Student<br>
In the begining you choose your personality, randomly get assigned a friend, and make decisions thoughout the day.<br>
These factors will effect your overall score at the end.<br>
(DISCLAIMER: It is impossible to get a full score because Stuy students can't "have it all")<br><br>

Although at first glance this may seem like just a boring terminal game, there are many secret gems in the adventure.<br>
Some of things to try in the code include...
<ul>
<li>Snoozing the alarm clock(The First Choice)</li>
<li>Waking up your friend(not always an option)</li>
<li>Seeing where different choices take you, not all options lead you to the same place</li>
</ul>
<br><br>


Some of the unresolved bugs we have and things we were unable to accomplish include
<ul>

</ul>
<br><br>

To compile our project you just have to compile Final.java.<br> 
All of the components pass through this one class so you just compile and run Final.java<br><br>

Using our program is very easy, since it is just a game.<br>
Although the instructions are in the program, one must have common sense to get through a day at Stuy.<br>
